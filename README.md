This course provides an in-depth study of money, commercial banking, and monetary-fiscal policy. Students will gain insights into the role of money, how interest rates are determined, central banking and its economic impacts both domestically and internationally, as well as the role of fiscal policy in price level determination. As an extension to these core topics, this course will discuss how blockchain technology is revolutionizing the financial sector by enabling decentralized ledgers, cryptographic security, and smart contracts.
